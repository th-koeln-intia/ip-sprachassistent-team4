# Node-RED
Node-RED is described as flow-base programming for the Internet of Things. 
It provides a browser-based editor that makes it easy to wire together flows using the wide range of nodes in the 
palette that can be deployed to its runtime in a single-click.
 
Node-Red has different nodes which allows us to control our devices according to our needs. We will use this home 
automation for our current project.

# Installation of Node-RED

This command shows how to install Node-Red , Nodejs , Mosquitto as your MQTT Server in a simple line of commands.

```
sudo apt-get install mosquitto mosquitto-clients -y
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/node-red/linux-installers/master/deb/update-nodejs-andnodered)
sudo systemctl enable nodered.service # start Node-Red as service

```
Node-Red is now available at http://<hostname>:1880

# Setting a password for your node-Red [Optional]

if you want you can set a password  to your Node-Red  with following command 
```
sudo npm install -g node-red-admin # install node-red- admin package from node red package manager for global usage.
node-red-admin hash-pw # create a new password for your Node-Red, You will get a hash value as output.
nano ~/.node-red/settings.js # open settings.js files and uncomment adminAuth Object and set password  to the new created hash value.
node-red-stop #stop Node red
node-red-start # start node-red to make the change activ

```
# Nodes

Once you have Node-RED opened, you can see different Nodes available and over the menu button , you can add 
additional new packets.
Here are some important Nodes : 

- Switch: Checks, according to individual conditions, to which output the node sends the message should be forwarded.

- Change: Allows you to change individual properties in the message payload. So you can
Simply exchange parts of the message (or the entire message).
- Function: Probably the most powerful node, but also the most complicated. Here you can
Program freely in JavaScript and manipulate the messages or completely new messages
hand back
- RBE: Blocks further messages at the inbox until a change takes place. Here can
either the complete payload can be checked, or just a single property of the
Payload
- HTML: Extracts certain elements from a complex HTML construct using CSS selectors. Very practical for quickly 
  collecting individual values.
- Delay: Delays the incoming message by the set (or a random) time until it arrives
the output is passed on
- Trigger: Converts messages into a "status". E.g. ensure that the
Status is held "HIGH" as long as new messages are received.
